CW Buddy is a modular, cross-platform C++ application for receiving,
visualizing, decoding, and operator-assisted replying to amateur-radio CW. The
target platforms are Windows 11 or newer on x64, macOS Sonoma 14 or newer on
Apple silicon and Intel x64, and Linux; Windows is the first packaging target.

The project is in active pre-release development, and unsigned desktop builds
are published for every supported platform on each green run. A dependency-free
core supplies the primitives and their tests. The Qt Quick desktop application
above it runs the whole receive path: a profile chooser, guided setup,
persistent radio/keying/display settings, native live audio-input
discovery/capture through a bounded queue and dedicated DSP worker, direct SDR
reception, radio frequency control, and a guarded transmit and QSO panel that
cannot be armed by the decoder. WAV replay remains a separate deterministic
source for the real 2D spectrum and waterfall, and a direct SDR source can be
recorded as an interoperable SigMF IQ pair for later analysis. Immediate
controls below the spectrum provide signal gain/bandwidth, constant-time
high-resolution history, a CW frequency guide, and stable noise-suppressed
display tuning. A receive-only full-passband channel
bank detects multiple spectral peaks, then derives independent keying evidence
from the original samples through a phase-continuous narrowband filter for each
frequency. It evaluates bounded 8–60 WPM timing hypotheses, maintains adaptive
timing state, and shows color-linked spectrum markers and decode rows. The
700 Hz guide is visual only. At a checkpoint or a completed turn the same run
lattice is re-decoded against nearby timing hypotheses, and a different pass
replaces the live one only when it covers substantially the same interval and
improves acoustic cost by both an absolute and a relative margin. Decoding a
signal below the measured decode threshold is an operator setting that is off
by default: under it a track is still acquired, followed, and drawn, and once
it has had long enough to show its level it is neither filtered nor decoded, so
the cost of a busy band follows the signals actually being copied rather than
every signal tracked.

## Current and planned capabilities

- Advanced live-audio channel, sample-rate, buffer, calibration, and level-meter
  controls (cross-platform capture plus DC rejection, manual/automatic gain,
  and manual/automatic processing bandwidth are implemented)
- Direct receive-only RTL-SDR IQ reception through the SoapySDR module provided
  by official packages; SDRplay reception uses the same internal boundary
  after the operator installs the compatible vendor API and SoapySDRPlay3
  module. Physical-device qualification remains in progress.
- Selectable receive-only network SDR directory, with KiwiSDR streaming first
  and browser handoff for receiver types without an authorized client API
  (planned; only the receiver-protocol boundary exists today)
- Debug capture of a direct SDR source as an interoperable SigMF IQ pair
  (`ci16_le` by default), bounded by an explicit byte and duration budget
- Live-source and WAV-replay spectrum with scrolling waterfall
- Alternative-width/drift refinement of the implemented raw-sample narrowband
  full-passband multi-channel decoder
- Suppression of uncopyable text, in which a run of six or more one- and
  two-element characters is replaced by a single space rather than deleted, so
  the transcript says plainly that something there could not be copied
- Operator-editable data files for the exchange vocabulary, the word-gap
  prefixes, the distinctive tokens, the Morse alphabet, and one exchange
  profile per contest; the copies installed with the application are
  authoritative and an operator copy is used only when it parses, and the
  alphabet is additionally compiled in as a last-resort fallback generated from
  the same file
- Strongest-signal, arrival-queue, and operator-selected channel scheduling
- Configurable 2D spectrum bounds, FPS, waterfall speed, averaging, peak hold,
  and grid/callsign overlays; the spectrum trace keeps twelve decibels of
  headroom below the estimated noise floor, the waterfall palette starts above
  that baseline so none of its range is spent coloring noise, and retuning
  slides the existing waterfall history by the bins the band moved instead of
  erasing it
- Callsign ignore list enforced by display, queue, and TX safety (the policy
  is implemented in the core; persistence and its operator control are planned)
- Standalone, station-server, and remote-client roles with secure control,
  receive audio/spectrum streaming, and station-local CW timing (planned; the
  control-lease and transmit-request types exist in the core, and no role
  beyond standalone is wired into the application yet)
- Multiple saved station profiles with a startup chooser and isolated settings,
  allowing separate application instances to operate separate radios
- Windows OmniRig, portable Hamlib, and CAT4OM network frequency-control paths
- Yaesu FT-450D and FT-818/FT-818ND editable reference configurations
- Separate configurable serial port and RTS/DTR lines for PTT and keying
- Human-confirmed QSO initiation with ordinary, DX-pileup, and contest panels
- Transmission of the seven prosigns `<AR>`, `<AS>`, `<BK>`, `<CT>`, `<KN>`,
  `<SK>` and `<SOS>`, each keyed as one symbol with no character gap between
  its letters; the table is closed and lives in the application rather than a
  data file, because what may be transmitted is a safety boundary
- ADIF 3 records sent to Log4OM 2 through its inbound UDP integration
- Deterministic replay of audio and IQ captures for decoder regression tests
- A documented high-accuracy decoder strategy with explainable timing and an
  optional compact causal inference backend, both implemented, alongside
  same-frequency pileup separation, which is not yet built

## Architecture

The real-time capture callback only packages samples into a bounded SPSC ring.
A DSP worker performs shared spectral analysis and bounded per-track raw-sample
mixing/filtering. Each channel has its own filter, timing, decoder, and
confidence state; it does not own an operating-system thread. A bounded worker
pool remains planned for later expensive refinement passes.

See [the architecture](docs/architecture.md), [requirements](docs/requirements.md),
[prioritized backlog](BACKLOG.md), [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), and
[roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). Operator-facing setup and examples are maintained in
the [user manuals](docs/manuals/README.md). The graphical architecture is recorded in
[ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-qt-quick-spectrum-renderer.md).
The decoder pipeline and its measurable acceptance gates are recorded in the
[high-accuracy decoder strategy](docs/decoder-strategy.md).
ADIF release gates and official-fixture verification are documented in the
[ADIF conformance policy](docs/adif-conformance.md).

## Build the current core

Requirements: a C++20 compiler and CMake 3.24 or newer.

```sh
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

The development host starts in a hardware-safe state:

```sh
./build/dev/src/app/cw-buddy
```

The Qt desktop shell requires Qt 6.5 or newer with Core, Gui, Multimedia,
Network, QML, Quick, Quick Controls, Quick Dialogs, SerialPort, and WebSockets:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/desktop -DCWA_BUILD_DESKTOP=ON
cmake --build build/desktop
./build/desktop/src/desktop/cw-buddy-desktop --profile default
```

When multiple station profiles exist, the desktop opens a profile chooser.
`--profile NAME` bypasses the chooser for dedicated shortcuts, remote stations,
and parallel instances.

The desktop currently uses Qt 6, including Qt Multimedia for audio capture.
Official packages enable direct SDR reception and provide the redistributable
SoapySDR and RTL-SDR runtime, either inside a portable package or through the
Linux `.deb` dependency. SDRplay additionally requires the operator to install
the vendor's platform-specific API/driver and a compatible SoapySDRPlay3
module; CW Buddy does not redistribute that proprietary runtime. No separate
SDR application is needed. Custom source builds use
`-DCWA_ENABLE_SOAPY_SDR=ON` and the matching development package.

Every push to `main` and pull request builds and tests natively on Windows x64,
Linux x64, macOS ARM64, and macOS x64 with a Sonoma 14 deployment target, then
publishes downloadable desktop artifacts; Linux also produces a Debian/Ubuntu `.deb`. Pull requests containing
implementation, test, build, or workflow changes must update the user manuals,
changelog, and backlog.

## Safety

Decoded text can never directly assert PTT or KEY. Transmission starts
disarmed, requires an explicit arm action, a selected callsign, a matching
operator confirmation, a preview of the exact message and a confirmation of
that text, and a healthy keying adapter. A continuous-key watchdog independent
of the transmit path latches a fault if the line stays asserted outside a
guarded transmission or beyond a fixed deadline, and an emergency release
drops every line. Timeouts and emergency release are required before hardware
TX is enabled.
